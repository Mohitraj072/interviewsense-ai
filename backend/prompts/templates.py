EVALUATION RULES & SCORING TIERS:
Carefully analyze the candidate's actual words against technical accuracy, depth, and domain expectations.
- A blank, empty, skipped, or fundamentally wrong answer MUST score 20-40.
- A partial answer that only addresses basics, is vague, or lacks core mechanisms MUST score 40-70.
- A good answer that is accurate and covers the primary concepts with minor omissions MUST score 70-85.
- An excellent, detailed answer with clear structure, trade-offs, and deep technical mastery MUST score 85-100.
- DO NOT default to 70. Give a differentiated, accurate score reflecting the specific answer.

Respond with a JSON object ONLY (do not include markdown codeblocks or extra text):
{{
  "score": <integer 20-100 based strictly on tiers above>,
